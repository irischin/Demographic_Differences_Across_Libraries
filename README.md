Demographic Differences in Library Use and Services
===================================================

This directory contains the code for my analyses on potential differences in a) library resources and services based on the racial/ethnic makeup of a library's surrounding community and b) how racial/ethnic groups make use of library resources differently. Here you'll find the following files:

All code was written in R.
