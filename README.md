Demographic Differences in Library Use and Services
===================================================

This directory contains the code for my analyses on potential differences in a) library resources and services based on the racial/ethnic makeup of a library's surrounding community and b) how racial/ethnic groups make use of library resources differently. Here you'll find the following files:

| Creating\_dataset.md                                        | Markdown file with details on the different data sources I used and the code used to generate the main dataset involved in the subsequent analyses                                                            |
| Demographic\_Differences\_Across\_Library\_Use\_Services.md | Markdown file with details on the different analyses I performed to investigate the questions regarding demographic differences in library use and services                                                   |
| Success\_of\_City\_Libraries.md                             | Markdown file detailing different analyses that used machine learning techniques to predict success of libraries in the dataset (analyses involved here were not included in write-up/blog-post linked below) |

All code was written in R.
